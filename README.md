# 🎬 Movie Ticket Booking Application (Core Java)

## 📖 Overview
The **Movie Ticket Booking Application** is a **console-based Java project** built using Core Java concepts such as classes, arrays, loops, conditionals, and user input handling.

This project simulates a simple movie ticket booking system where a user can:

1. Select a movie  
2. Book available seats  
3. Cancel booked tickets  
4. Check seat availability  

All operations are performed in the **command-line interface (CLI)** — no database, GUI, or web technologies are used.

This project demonstrates fundamental **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** and Java basics, including:

- Classes and Objects  
- Methods and Variables  
- Control Statements (`if`, `switch`, loops)  
- Arrays (to track seat bookings)  
- User Input using `Scanner`  
- Simple Menu-driven program using `do-while` loop
