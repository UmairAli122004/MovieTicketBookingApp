ðŸŽ¬ Movie Ticket Booking Application (Core Java)
ðŸ“– Overview

The Movie Ticket Booking Application is a console-based Java project built using Core Java concepts such as classes, arrays, loops, conditionals, and user input handling.

This project simulates a simple movie ticket booking system where a user can:
  1) Select a movie
  2) Book available seats
  3) Cancel booked tickets
  4) Check seat availability

All operations are performed in the command-line interface (CLI) â€” no database, GUI, or web technologies are used.

ðŸ§© Features

âœ… Select a Movie:
  1)Users can choose from a list of predefined movies.

âœ… Book Tickets:
  1)Displays available seats and allows users to book one by entering the seat number.
  2)Prevents double booking of the same seat.

âœ… Cancel Tickets:
  1)Users can cancel their booked ticket by entering their seat number.

âœ… Check Seat Availability:
  1)Displays the complete seat arrangement, showing which seats are available and which are reserved.

âœ… Console-Based Application:
  1)Built purely with Core Java (no MySQL, JDBC, Servlets, JSP, or frameworks).

ðŸ§  Core Concepts Used

This project demonstrates fundamental Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) and Java basics, including:
 . Classes and Objects
 . Methods and Variables
 . Control Statements (if, switch, loops)
 . Arrays (to track seat bookings)
 . User Input using Scanner
 . Simple Menu-driven program (do-while loop)
